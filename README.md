#### How to run: 
1. Import this project in the Eclipse. 
2. Add JUNIT 4 as a library into your lib folder.
3. To run the JUnit Test Cases, simply run the program "com.disjoint.test.unit.UnitTestDisjointSolution". It has around 12 Unit Test Cases which test different scenarios.
4. I have also created an Interactive Mode to do live testing of the program. To use the same, please run the program "com.disjoint.test.DisjointSolution". It will give you a prompt on your console asking for 3 options as shown below:

	This is Disjoint Integer Set test Program.

	1. Add Set
	2. Remove Set
	3. Exit

	Please make your choice : 

Choose 1 to Add a New Set
Choose 2 to Remove a Set
Choose 3 to Exit the Test Case

Once you chose either option 1 or 2, It will again prompt to enter the Start Number and the End Number and once u enter the same it will perform the operation and show you the updated list.

#### Approach: 
- This program contain solution for disjoint interval of integers.
- The DisjoinSolution class contain two static method add() and remove
- Which is used to update disjoint series.
